<h2>CHANGES IN THE BODY </h2>

<ul> 
<li>As the baby grows, you will begin to show and may experience mood swings, 
intense food cravings, fatigue, weight gain, morning sickness, tender breasts, and nausea. </li>
<li>During this week, many women have their first ultrasound done to make sure 
that everything is alright with mother and baby and to get a first glimpse of their embryo. </li>
</ul>

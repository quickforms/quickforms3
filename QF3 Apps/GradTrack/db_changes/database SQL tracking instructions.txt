 == Adding SQL files ==
 Before adding your sql changes, ensure your svn is up to date by right clicking this folder and clicking tortoiseSVN update
 Name your sql file as follows "<username> - <changes type> - <date>.sql".
 Ensure your sql file is in the correct release number folder
 
 == Merge to build process ==
 
Every release, all of the individual sql files must be merged incrementally into the build file to keep the file up to date. 

Do not copy over fact data. Only schema changes and sql_queries rows.
